# Basics 3: Transactions

*Skip tutorial and see [the code](https://jsbin.com/hucufav/edit?html,output).*

Building on [Basics 2: Nimiq Style UI](tutorial-02-UI.md),
now we are almost ready to receive some NIM.

But first, we need a wallet. And a place to store it.

## Create and Store a Wallet

Creating a [Nimiq Wallet](https://github.com/nimiq-network/core/blob/ed21cda4dcdf1d4cee24842f2e1cb56c1240565e/src/main/generic/wallet/Wallet.js) is as simple as:

```js
const wallet = await Nimiq.Wallet.generate();
```

And then we can use the `localStorage` to store the wallet.
With this snippet in `start()` the app will first try to load the wallet from `localStorage` and
and if that fails create a new wallet and store it.

```js
// Load or generate a wallet. And store it again.
const stored = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('wallet'));
const wallet = stored ? Nimiq.Wallet.loadPlain(stored) : await Nimiq.Wallet.generate();
localStorage.setItem('wallet', JSON.stringify(Array.from(wallet.exportPlain())));
```

Now that we use more and more functionalities, there are many objects to interact with.
As a rough idea, use the `consensus` to find out about balances and account states,
`blockchain` for the latest block and block height,
`network`&hellip; you guessed it, and
`mempool` for transactions that are waiting to be mined.
So let's keep a reference to them:

```js
Object.assign(nimiq, { consensus, blockchain, network, mempool, wallet });
```

For showing our wallet's address and balance, we add two fields to `<div id="info">`

```html
<p>Account address: <span id="address">loading&hellip;</span></p>
<p>Balance: <span id="balance">loading&hellip;</span></p>
```

&hellip;and update the balance as soon as consensus is established
and again each time a new block gets minded ("head of the blockchain has changed").

```js
function onConsensusEstablished() {
    status('Consensus established');
    $('height').innerText = nimiq.blockchain.height;
    $('address').innerText = nimiq.wallet.address.toUserFriendlyAddress();

    updateBalance();
}

function onHeadChanged() {
    $('height').innerText = nimiq.blockchain.height;

    updateBalance();
}

```

The `consensus` object can get us the latest account status which includes the balance in Luna (satoshi).

```js
function updateBalance() {
    nimiq.consensus
        .getAccount(nimiq.wallet.address)
        .then(account => {
            account = account || Nimiq.BasicAccount.INITIAL;
            $('balance').innerText = Nimiq.Policy.satoshisToCoins(account.balance).toFixed(2);
        });
}
```

To see the stored wallet, run [the example](https://jsbin.com/hucufav/edit?html,output), open your dev tools (F12), and enter:

```js
localStorage.getItem('wallet');
```

What you will get back is an array of bytes representing your serialized private key.

**Wallet âœ…** &ndash; Off to receiving and sending transactions&hellip;

## Receive Transaction

To receive a transactions, copy the address shown and send a transaction to it using a
[Nimiq Safe](https://safe.nimiq.com) account or
receive some NIM from our [faucet](https://getsome.nimiq.com).
Nimiq's block time is one minute in average,
so it might take a little for the transaction to be confirmed.

The Nano Client can monitor the network for incoming transaction:
We subscribe (in `start()`) to all transactions related to our wallet's address and
display a message if one is incoming.

```js
consensus.addSubscriptions([wallet.address]);
mempool.on('transaction-added', tx => {
    if (tx.recipient.equals(wallet.address)) {
        status(`Incoming transaction of ${ Nimiq.Policy.satoshisToCoins(tx.value) } NIM.`);
    }
});
```

## Send Transactions

To send, we add a little form to the `nq-card-body` with address &amp; value and wire it up.

```html
<div id="transaction">
    <h2>Send Transaction</h2>
    <p>
        <label class="nq-label" for="tx_address">Recipient Address</label>
        <input type="string" id="tx_address">
    </p>
    <p>
        <label class="nq-label" for="tx_amount">Amount</label>
        <input type="number" id="tx_amount">
    </p>
    <button id="tx_send" class="nq-button">Send Transaction</button>
</div>
```

Listen to the button being clicked in `start()`:

```js
$('tx_send').addEventListener('click', () =>
    sendTransaction(
        $('tx_address').value,
        parseInt($('tx_amount').value))
);
```

&hellip; and create a transaction object and relay it to the network.
`wallet.createTransaction()` is a short-hand for `new BasicTransaction(wallet.publicKey, recipient, ...)` and
it also takes care of signing the transaction for you.

```js
function sendTransaction(address, amount) {
    const transaction = nimiq.wallet.createTransaction(
        Nimiq.Address.fromUserFriendlyAddress(address),
        Nimiq.Policy.coinsToSatoshis(amount),
        0,
        nimiq.blockchain.height
    );
    nimiq.consensus.relayTransaction(transaction);
    ...
```

The `0` in the middle is the fee in Luna.
In Nimiq, up to ten transactions per block per sender are free.
*(Precisely, nodes will accept only up to ten free transactions from the same sender in the `mempool`)*
After that, a minimum of one Luna per byte is required.
A basic transaction (without a message) is 138 bytes.
An extended transaction 144 bytes + the length of the message (called `extra_data`).

To show some feedback while the transaction is going out, we can add some code like below.
It will listen on events (`on()`) to understand when
the transaction gets into the mempool, when it hits the network, and finally, when it got mined.
After that, the event listeners will be unregistered with `off()`.

```js
    ...
    function feedback(source, event, message) {
        const id = source.on(event, tx => {
            if (tx.sender.equals(nimiq.wallet.address)) {
                status(message);
                console.log(message);
                source.off(event, id);
            }
        });
    };

    feedback(
        nimiq.mempool,
        'transaction-added',
        'Your transaction has been sent out.');
    feedback(
        nimiq.consensus,
        'transaction-relayed',
        'Your transaction is in the network.');
    feedback(
        nimiq.mempool,
        'transaction-mined',
        'Your transaction arrived.');
}
```

Listening to network activities depends on whether the nano client is connected to a full node
and thus might fail.

## Get some NIM

This little demo app has all the basic functionality to be a minimal wallet app.
So now we're ready to receive some NIM!
Start the [example on JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/hucufav/edit?html,output)
and switch to Mainnet in `start()`.

```js
Nimiq.GenesisConfig.main();
```

Copy the `address` shown in the app and head over to
[getsome.nimiq.com](https://getsome.nimiq.com).
Follow the Nimiq Onboarding Guide, create a wallet in the Nimiq Account Manager and receive one NIM.
Finally you'll arrive in the Nimiq Safe from where you can send the NIM to your address here.
And you can also send it back to keep it. :)

**Your Nano Wallet is a full member of the Nimiq network.
The transaction went in and out from your node without any trusted third party.
All from within your browser with not much more than 100 lines of JavaScript!
Congratulations, and welcome to the Nimiq Ecosystem!**

## More ideas

**Encryption**: Right now, your private key is stored unencrypted.
You can replace `exportPlain()` with `exportEncrypted(password)` and `loadPlain()` with `loadEncrypted(password)`.

**Error handling**: Finally, before publishing this Nano Wallet, we should add some error handling.
Something along the lines of:

```js
function onError(code) {
    switch (code) {
        case Nimiq.ERR_WAIT:
            alert('Error: Already open in another tab or window.');
            break;
        case Nimiq.ERR_UNSUPPORTED:
            alert('Error: Browser not supported');
            break;
        default:
            alert('Error: Nimiq initialization error');
            break;
    }
}

window.onload = () => Nimiq.init(start, onError);
```
